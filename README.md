# Habyte - Will **you** do your task?
A tool for your everyday life.
Habyte is an application that is tracking your habits of choice with simple clicks.
It is reminding you, what person you want to become and how you can achieve it, step by step, everyday.

### An Idea - Developer Note:
I am starting this project because I realized how powerful habits are in the end of 2022.
It was when I started reading the book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), which I highly recommend, I realized how I need to make changes in my life.
Soon after an idea came to my mind.
What if I would make an application for my browser and my phone which would track the good habits I am building, while reenforcing it with methods I learned from James Clear and other resources, like the [HubermanLab](https://www.hubermanlab.com/)?
This is my answer to this very question.
